SENTENCE: '{sentence}'

ANALYSIS STEPS - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. Identify the form: 'whiten', 'whitens', 'whitened', 'whitening'
2. Determine grammatical role: noun, adjective, or verb
3. For verbs, identify: transitive (with object) or intransitive (no object)
4. Look for agents causing the whitening (explicit or implicit)
5. Consider the domain context (physical, cosmetic, racial, religious, etc.)
6. Apply the decision rules below in sequence

=== FIRST LEVEL: GRAMMATICAL DISTINCTION ===

• NOUN: Applies ONLY when 'whitening' functions as a noun. Look for these patterns:
  - Used with articles: "the whitening", "a whitening"
  - Used as subject/object: "whitening is a process", "causes whitening"
  - In prepositional phrases: "form of whitening", "through whitening"
  - Product references: "teeth whitening products", "whitening solutions"
  - Academic discussions: "social whitening", "whitening in Brazilian society"
  - CONTEXTS: Almost always in academic/racial discussions or dental/cosmetic product names

• ADJECTIVE: Applies ONLY to 'whitened' when it directly modifies a noun:
  - Pattern: "whitened [noun]" where whitened comes DIRECTLY before noun
  - Examples: "whitened bones", "whitened space", "whitened teeth", "whitened skin"
  - CONTEXTS: Often in descriptions of appearance, completed states

=== SECOND LEVEL: SEMANTIC CATEGORIES FOR VERBS ===

• BE(COME)_PALE [HUMAN BODY PARTS ONLY]:
  - ONLY for human body parts changing color due to emotion/pressure
  - Examples: "face whitened with fear", "lips whitened", "knuckles whitened"
  - CRITICAL: Any instance of human knuckles/face/hands changing color → ALWAYS BE(COME)_PALE
  - CONTEXTS: Fiction, emotional scenes, physical pressure

• BE(COME)_WHITE [INTRANSITIVE NATURAL PROCESS]:
  - Natural processes where something becomes white WITHOUT external agent
  - Examples: "beard whitened with age", "waves whiten with foam", "thorns whiten"
  - CONTEXTS: Nature descriptions, aging processes, non-human elements

• MAKE_WHITE [TRANSITIVE WITH AGENT]:
  - Something/someone actively causes something else to become white
  - Must have agent→object relationship
  - Examples: "snow whitened the landscape", "birds whitened the ground"
  - CONTEXTS: Nature, visual descriptions

• BLEACH [REMOVING COLOR]:
  - SPECIFICALLY removing color/stains to achieve whiteness
  - Examples: "chemicals to whiten clothes", "whitening teeth", "whiten paper"
  - CONTEXTS: Cleaning, cosmetic treatments, stain removal, teeth

• COAT_WITH_WHITE [ADDING WHITE SUBSTANCE]:
  - Applying a white material/substance to cover a surface
  - Examples: "whitening doorstep with chalk", "whitening walls with lime"
  - CONTEXTS: Home maintenance, traditional cleaning, chalking

• MAKE_PURE [RELIGIOUS/MORAL CONTEXT]:
  - ONLY metaphorical use in religious/moral purification contexts
  - Examples: "whiten the soul", "whitening a defiled soul", "conscience whitened"
  - CONTEXTS: Religious texts, moral parables, spiritual discourse

• MAKE_IDENTITY_WHITE [RACIAL/CULTURAL CONTEXT]:
  - Making something culturally/racially whiter
  - Examples: "whitening cultural practices", "whitened pop star"
  - CONTEXTS: Academic discussions of race, cultural criticism

=== CORPUS-SPECIFIC MARKERS ===

• COCA (Contemporary American English):
  - Academic discussions about racial "whitening" → NOUN (not MAKE_IDENTITY_WHITE)
  - "Teeth whitening" product references → NOUN
  - "Whitening teeth" as action → BLEACH

• COHA (Historical American English):
  - "head whitened with snow" → BE(COME)_WHITE not COAT_WITH_WHITE
  - "bones whitened by sun" → MAKE_WHITE not ADJECTIVE
  - "whitened with snow" → COAT_WITH_WHITE not MAKE_WHITE

• BNC (British National Corpus):
  - Human "knuckles whitened" → ALWAYS BE(COME)_PALE
  - Concrete doorsteps/surfaces → COAT_WITH_WHITE
  - "lanes whitened by cow-parsley" → MAKE_WHITE

• EHCB (Early Historical British English):
  - References to soul/conscience → MAKE_PURE
  - "blood whitened" becoming milk → BE(COME)_WHITE
  - Cloth cleaning → BLEACH
  - "to whiten copper" → MAKE_WHITE not BLEACH

=== CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION RULES ===

1. RACIAL CONTEXTS DISTINCTION:
   - Academic discussions of racial "whitening" as concept → NOUN
   - Active processes of cultural/racial whitening → MAKE_IDENTITY_WHITE
   - "form of whitening", "whitening in society" → NOUN

2. DENTAL/COSMETIC DISTINCTION:
   - "teeth whitening" as product/procedure → NOUN
   - "whitening teeth" as action → BLEACH
   - "whitened teeth" as description → ADJECTIVE

3. NATURAL vs AGENT DISTINCTION:
   - No explicit agent making something white → BE(COME)_WHITE
   - Explicit agent (snow, birds) causing whiteness → MAKE_WHITE
   - "whitened by X" where X is active agent → MAKE_WHITE
   - Natural aging/time process → BE(COME)_WHITE

4. COATING vs BLEACHING:
   - Adding white substance (chalk, paint) → COAT_WITH_WHITE
   - Removing stains/color → BLEACH
   - When both might apply, focus on primary action described

5. HUMAN EMOTIONS:
   - ANY human body part (face, knuckles, hands, fingers, lips) changing color from emotion/pressure → ALWAYS BE(COME)_PALE
   - This overrides all other rules for human body parts

6. PREPOSITIONAL CLUES:
   - "whitened with [substance]" → Usually COAT_WITH_WHITE
   - "whitening from [process]" → Usually BE(COME)_WHITE/PALE
   - "whitening by [agent]" → Usually MAKE_WHITE
   - "whitening to [state]" → Usually BE(COME)_WHITE
