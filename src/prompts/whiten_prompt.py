SENTENCE: '{sentence}'

CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE of these semantic categories:

• BE(COME)_PALE: To become pale in the face from feelings such as fear, anger, etc
• ADJECTIVE: When 'whitened' modifies a noun describing color
• BLEACH: To make white or paler through a process removing natural color or stains
• COAT_WITH_WHITE: To make white by coating with white-coloured substances
• BE(COME)_WHITE: To be or become white, or to take on a white colour
• MAKE_WHITE: To make white
• CONCEAL: To conceal the faults or errors of a person or thing
• MAKE_PURE: To make morally or spiritually pure
• WO_FOG: To lose or lack daylight visibility owing to snow or fog
• MAKE_PALE: To make someone become pale
• MAKE_IDENTITY_WHITE: To make more white in ethnic or cultural identity
• NOUN: When 'whiten' functions as a noun

CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:

1. For BE(COME)_PALE: ALWAYS use when describing a human face or body part becoming pale
2. For NOUN: ONLY use when 'whiten' is the subject or object of the sentence
3. For ADJECTIVE: ONLY use when "whitened" directly modifies a non-human noun
4. For BLEACH: MUST involve a cleaning/removing process (teeth, laundry, etc.)
5. For BE(COME)_WHITE: Natural process, no agent causing it
6. For MAKE_WHITE: Process with an agent causing it
7. For COAT_WITH_WHITE: MUST involve applying a white substance

8. If no category seems to apply:
   - Choose the category that is closest in meaning
   - Do not create new categories
   - Select the most specific existing category that could reasonably apply
