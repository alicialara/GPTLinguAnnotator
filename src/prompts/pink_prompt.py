SENTENCE: '{sentence}'

## CRITICAL FIRST ASSESSMENT - DETERMINE PRIMARY FUNCTION

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE EXACT GRAMMATICAL FORM AND CONTEXT
- Is the word functioning as NOUN, ADJECTIVE, or VERB?
- If NOUN: Is it referring to a color, flower, or snooker ball?
- If ADJECTIVE: Is it modifying another word?
- If VERB: Is it an action describing cutting/piercing OR a color change?

STEP 2: DETERMINE HISTORICAL AND DOMAIN CONTEXT
- Identify corpus markers (EHCB = older, BNC = modern British, COCA = American)
- Check for technical contexts (sewing, hunting, sports, medical)
- Look for time period indicators (archaic language, modern slang)

## PRECISE CATEGORY SELECTION - FOLLOW THESE STRICT RULES

✓ HUNTING ATTIRE or FOXHUNTING COLOR ("he wore pink to the hunt")
EXAMPLES: "a soft pink," "the pinks in her garden," "he missed the pink"

### ADJECTIVE CATEGORY [MANDATORY MARKERS]
SELECT ONLY if:
✓ MODIFIES a NOUN directly ("pink dress," "pink cheeks")
✓ FOLLOWS linking verb to describe appearance ("the sky is pink")
✓ Used in COMPOUND COLOR TERMS ("pink-spotted," "pink-tinged")
EXAMPLES: "pink roses," "pink shoes," "his face was pink"

### BE(COME)_PINK CATEGORY [MANDATORY MARKERS]
SELECT ONLY if:

✓ About NATURAL PROCESSES (dawn/dusk coloration, health changes)
✓ Subject BECOMES pink due to physical/natural causes
EXAMPLES: "the sky pinked at dawn," "his skin pinked up after birth"

### MAKE_PINK CATEGORY [MANDATORY MARKERS]

### BLUSH CATEGORY [MANDATORY MARKERS]

✓ PATTERN: "pinked with embarrassment," "cheeks pinked"
EXAMPLES: "she pinked at his compliment," "his face pinked with shame"

## CRITICAL ERROR CORRECTION - APPLY THESE FIRST

1. COMMON MISCLASSIFICATION FIXES:

   ✓ "Engine pinking/knocking" → NONE (automotive, not color)
   ✓ "Pink" in snooker/billiards → NOUN
   ✓ "Pink with embarrassment" → BLUSH (not BE(COME)_PINK)

2. CORPUS-SPECIFIC RULES:

   ✓ EHCB: Any mention of "pinking" older texts → NONE (usually cutting)
   ✓ BNC: Hunting references to "pink" → NOUN
   ✓ COHA: Dueling contexts with "pinked" → NONE (means stabbed/wounded)

3. CONTEXT DISAMBIGUATION:
   ✓ "Pinked up" in MEDICAL context → BE(COME)_PINK
   ✓ "Pinked in battle/duel" → NONE (wounded)
   ✓ "Pinked with" + tool/weapon → NONE
   ✓ "Pinked with" + emotion → BLUSH

4. ADJACENT WORD MARKERS:
   ✓ "Edges," "fabric," "material" + "pinked" → NONE
   ✓ "Cheeks," "face" + "pinked" + emotion → BLUSH
   ✓ "Sky," "horizon," "clouds" + "pinked" → BE(COME)_PINK or MAKE_PINK (check agent)
   ✓ "Snooker," "potted," "missed" + "pink" → NOUN
