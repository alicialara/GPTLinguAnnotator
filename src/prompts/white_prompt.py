Your task is to analyze with extreme precision the semantics of 'white' in the provided sentence.

SENTENCE: '{sentence}'

### PROTOCOL FOR CLASSIFICATION ###

STEP 1: IDENTIFY FORM
□ Is 'white/whited/whiting' functioning as:
   • A standalone NOUN ("the whites", "whiting")?
   • An ADJECTIVE modifying a noun ("white wall")?
   • A VERB describing an action ("they whited the walls")?
   • A PAST PARTICIPLE ("whited sepulchre")?

STEP 2: IDENTIFY CONTEXTUAL PERIOD
□ Is this:
   • HISTORICAL TEXT (pre-1900)?
   • CONTEMPORARY TEXT?
   • BIBLICAL/RELIGIOUS REFERENCE?
   • TECHNICAL/SPECIALIZED DOMAIN?
