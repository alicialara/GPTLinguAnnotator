SENTENCE: '{sentence}'

### CLASSIFICATION PROTOCOL ###

STEP 1: IDENTIFY GRAMMATICAL FORM
□ Is 'red' functioning as:
   • A NOUN (standalone or referring to the color itself)?
   • An ADJECTIVE (modifying another noun)?
   • A VERB or verbal element (becoming red or making something red)?

STEP 2: IDENTIFY CONTEXTUAL DOMAIN
□ In what domain is 'red' being used:
   • Physical description of color
   • Metaphorical/figurative language
   • Political/ideological context
   • Technical/specialized usage

STEP 3: SELECT EXACTLY ONE CATEGORY using the following criteria:

### MANDATORY CATEGORIES WITH CLEAR CRITERIA ###

◉ NOUN: Use ONLY when 'red' functions as a noun. Look for:
   » Standalone references to the color: "the red of the sunset"
   » With articles: "a vibrant red", "the red"
   » As subject/object: "Red is my favorite color"
   » Color categories: "different shades of red"
   » REQUIRES: Functions independently without modifying another word
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "the red of the sunset", "a deep red", "reds and blues"

◉ ADJECTIVE: Use ONLY when 'red' modifies a noun by describing its color. Look for:
   » Direct modification: "red dress", "red car", "red wine"
   » Predicative usage: "her face was red", "the sky turned red"
   » Comparative forms: "redder", "more red"
   » REQUIRES: Describes quality/property of another word
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "red hair", "red blood", "the light was red"

◉ BE(COME)_RED: Use ONLY when describing a process of turning red. Look for:
   » Process or change of state
   » Intransitive usage (subject becoming red)
   » REQUIRES: Indication of change/transformation
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "the sky reddened at sunset", "her face became red with anger"

◉ NONE: Use ONLY if none of the above categories apply.

### ERROR CORRECTION RULES - APPLY THESE FIRST ###

1. NOUN vs ADJECTIVE disambiguation:
   ✓ If 'red' stands alone with an article ("the red"), it's a NOUN
   ✓ If 'red' is used in a list of colors ("reds, blues and greens"), it's a NOUN
   ✓ If 'red' is describing another object ("red car"), it's an ADJECTIVE
   ✓ In political contexts ("the Reds"), it's a NOUN

2. BE(COME)_RED vs ADJECTIVE:
   ✓ If the focus is on the process of changing color, use BE(COME)_RED
   ✓ If the focus is on the state/property, use ADJECTIVE

### SPECIFIC EXAMPLE ANALYSIS ###

1. "The walls were painted a bright red."
   CATEGORY: NOUN - Standalone color reference with article

2. "Her face turned red with embarrassment."
   CATEGORY: ADJECTIVE - Describes state after turning

3. "The sky began to redden as the sun set."
   CATEGORY: BE(COME)_RED - Process of color change

4. "She wore a red dress to the party."
   CATEGORY: ADJECTIVE - Modifies the noun "dress"

5. "The deep red of the sunset was spectacular."
   CATEGORY: NOUN - Standalone color with article

6. "Communist China was often referred to as Red China."
   CATEGORY: ADJECTIVE - Modifies "China"

FINAL INSTRUCTION: You must select EXACTLY ONE category. Your classification must adhere strictly to the criteria above, with special attention to grammatical function and contextual usage.
