### CLASSIFICATION PROTOCOL ###

STEP 1: IDENTIFY GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION
□ How is 'redden' being used:
   • As a VERB (action of becoming or making red)?
   • As a NOUN (nominalization of the verb)?
   • As an ADJECTIVE (reddened as descriptor)?

STEP 2: IDENTIFY SUBJECT AND CAUSE
□ What is becoming red:
   • Human face/skin (emotional response)
   • Eyes (physical condition)
   • Sky/clouds (natural phenomenon)
   • Other object/substance

STEP 3: SELECT EXACTLY ONE CATEGORY using these strict criteria:

### MANDATORY CATEGORIES WITH DECISIVE CRITERIA ###

◉ BLUSH: Use ONLY when referring to human face/cheeks becoming red due to emotion. Look for:
   » SUBJECT: Face, cheeks, skin
   » CAUSE: Embarrassment, shame, modesty, anger
   » CONTEXT: Social interaction, emotional response
   » REQUIRES: Human subject experiencing emotion
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "Her cheeks reddened with embarrassment", "His face reddened at the compliment"

◉ EYES_RED: Use ONLY when specifically about eyes becoming red. Look for:
   » SUBJECT: Eyes, whites of the eyes
   » CAUSE: Crying, irritation, tiredness, illness
   » CONTEXT: Physical condition, strain
   » REQUIRES: Eyes as explicit subject
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "His eyes reddened from crying", "Her eyes had reddened due to lack of sleep"

◉ BE(COME)_RED: Use for non-human things becoming red naturally. Look for:
   » SUBJECT: Sky, horizon, leaves, natural phenomena
   » CAUSE: Natural process, without external agent
   » PATTERN: Intransitive usage (subject becomes red on its own)
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "The sky reddened at sunset", "The leaves reddened in autumn"

◉ MAKE_RED: Use when something/someone causes another thing to become red. Look for:
   » TRANSITIVE USAGE: Agent + object
   » CAUSATIVE: External action making something red
   » REQUIRES: Clear indication of agency
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "She reddened her lips with lipstick", "The dye reddened the fabric"

◉ ADJECTIVE: Use ONLY when 'reddened' functions as an adjective. Look for:
   » DESCRIPTIVE ROLE: Modifies a noun
   » PAST PARTICIPLE: "reddened" form describing state
   » PATTERN: "reddened [noun]" or "[noun] was reddened"
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "Her reddened face", "His reddened eyes betrayed his exhaustion"

◉ NOUN: Use ONLY when 'redden' is nominalized. Look for:
   » FUNCTIONING AS NOUN: Takes articles, can be plural
   » REFERS TO: The process/phenomenon itself
   » RARE USAGE: Uncommon nominalization of the verb
   ❗ KEY EXAMPLES: "The reddening of the sky", "A slight reddening was visible"

◉ NONE: Use ONLY if none of the above categories apply.

### ERROR CORRECTION RULES - APPLY THESE FIRST ###

1. BLUSH vs EYES_RED disambiguation:
   ✓ Focus on SUBJECT (face vs eyes)
   ✓ With ambiguous subjects, check for emotional (BLUSH) vs physical (EYES_RED) causes

2. BE(COME)_RED vs MAKE_RED:
   ✓ Check for AGENCY - if something/someone causes the reddening, use MAKE_RED
   ✓ If the reddening happens naturally, use BE(COME)_RED

3. ADJECTIVE vs verb forms:
   ✓ If 'reddened' is describing a noun's state, use ADJECTIVE
   ✓ If 'reddened' is describing the action, use the appropriate verb category

### SPECIFIC EXAMPLE ANALYSIS ###

1. "Her face reddened with embarrassment."
   CATEGORY: BLUSH - Human face becoming red due to emotion

2. "His eyes reddened after hours of staring at the computer screen."
   CATEGORY: EYES_RED - Eyes specifically becoming red due to strain

3. "The sky reddened as the sun began to set."
   CATEGORY: BE(COME)_RED - Natural process of changing color

4. "She reddened her lips with a new lipstick."
   CATEGORY: MAKE_RED - Agent causing something to become red

5. "His reddened face showed his anger."
   CATEGORY: ADJECTIVE - Describing the state of the face

6. "The autumn reddening of the leaves is beautiful."
