# Evaluation Metrics Explained for Literature Researchers

## Introduction

This document explains the evaluation metrics used in our semantic analysis project in non-technical language, making them accessible to literature researchers who may not be familiar with computational linguistics terminology.

## Basic Concepts

### What We're Measuring

In our study, we're essentially asking: "How well does our system understand the different meanings of words in various contexts?" To answer this question, we need ways to measure the system's performance that are both meaningful and easy to understand.

### The Gold Standard

For our evaluation, we use human expert annotations as our "gold standard" or "ground truth." These are the correct categorizations of word meanings as determined by literature and linguistics experts. We then compare our system's categorizations against these expert annotations to see how well it performs.

## Key Metrics Explained

### Accuracy

**What it is:** The simplest measure - the percentage of times our system correctly identifies the meaning of a word.

**In plain language:** If our system correctly identifies the meaning of a word 85 times out of 100, the accuracy is 85%.

**Why it matters:** It gives us a quick, overall sense of how well our system is performing. However, it doesn't tell us everything, especially if some meanings are much more common than others.

### Precision and Recall

**What they are:** Two complementary measures that help us understand different aspects of performance.

**Precision in plain language:** Of all the times our system says a word has a particular meaning, how often is it right? For example, if our system identifies 100 instances of a word as having meaning X, and 90 of those are correct, the precision is 90%.

**Recall in plain language:** Of all the actual instances of a word having a particular meaning, how many did our system correctly identify? For example, if there are 100 instances of a word having meaning X in our data, and our system correctly identifies 80 of them, the recall is 80%.

**Why they matter:** Precision tells us how reliable our system's identifications are, while recall tells us how thorough it is in finding all instances of a particular meaning.

### F1 Score

**What it is:** A single number that combines precision and recall.

**In plain language:** The F1 score is like a balanced average of precision and recall. It's high only when both precision and recall are high, giving us a single number that represents overall performance.

**Why it matters:** It helps us compare different systems or approaches when one might be better at precision and another at recall.

### Cohen's Kappa

**What it is:** A measure of agreement between different annotators or between a system and human annotators.

**In plain language:** It tells us how much better than chance our system's categorizations are. A score of 1.0 means perfect agreement, 0.0 means agreement no better than random guessing, and negative values mean agreement worse than random guessing.

**Why it matters:** It accounts for the fact that some agreement might happen by chance, giving us a more accurate picture of how well our system is really performing.

## Corpus-Specific Metrics

### Modern vs. Historical Corpora

**What we measure:** How well our system performs on texts from different time periods.

**In plain language:** We compare how well our system understands word meanings in contemporary texts versus older texts. This helps us understand how historical distance affects performance.

**Why it matters:** It tells us whether our system is better at understanding current usage or historical usage, which is important for literary analysis across different time periods.

### Regional Variation

**What we measure:** How well our system performs on texts from different English-speaking regions.

**In plain language:** We compare how well our system understands word meanings in British English versus American English, for example.

**Why it matters:** It helps us understand whether our system is better at understanding certain regional varieties of English, which is important for analyzing literature from different regions.

## Visualizing Performance

### Confusion Matrices

**What they are:** Tables that show how often our system confuses one meaning with another.

**In plain language:** They show us which meanings our system tends to mix up. For example, if our system often confuses meaning A with meaning B, this would be visible in the confusion matrix.

**Why they matter:** They help us identify specific patterns of errors, which can guide improvements to our system.

### Category Distribution

**What it is:** Charts showing how different meanings are distributed across our data.

**In plain language:** They show us how common each meaning is in our data, and how well our system identifies each meaning.

**Why it matters:** They help us understand whether our system performs better on common meanings or rare meanings, which is important for literary analysis where rare meanings might be particularly significant.

## Interpreting the Results

### What Good Performance Means

In our study, we consider:
- Accuracy above 80% to be good
- F1 scores above 0.8 to be good
- Cohen's Kappa above 0.6 to be good

**In plain language:** These thresholds mean our system is correctly identifying word meanings most of the time, with relatively few errors.

### Limitations of the Metrics

**What they don't tell us:**
- They don't capture the nuances of literary interpretation
- They don't account for the subjective nature of some meaning distinctions
- They don't measure the system's ability to understand complex literary devices

**In plain language:** While our metrics tell us how well our system performs on specific tasks, they don't capture everything that matters in literary analysis. They're tools to help us understand our system's performance, not complete measures of its value for literary research.

## Conclusion

These evaluation metrics provide us with ways to measure how well our system understands word meanings in different contexts. While they don't capture everything that matters in literary analysis, they give us valuable insights into our system's performance and help us identify areas for improvement.

For literature researchers, these metrics can be thought of as ways to assess how reliable our system is as a tool for analyzing word meanings in texts. The better the metrics, the more confidence you can have in using our system to support your literary research.
