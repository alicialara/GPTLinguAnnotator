# Comprehensive Results Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the semantic categorization results across all words and corpora in our study. We analyze the performance of GPT-4o-mini in categorizing semantic variations of the words "black," "blacken," and "whiten" across four major corpora: BNC (British National Corpus), COCA (Corpus of Contemporary American English), COHA (Corpus of Historical American English), and EHCB (Early Historical Corpus of British English).
