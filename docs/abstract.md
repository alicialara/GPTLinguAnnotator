# Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive study of semantic variation across different historical periods and regional varieties of English, utilizing state-of-the-art language models and corpus-based analysis. The research employs a mixed-methods approach combining computational linguistics, corpus analysis, and expert annotation to examine semantic categories and their evolution over time. Using four major corpora (BNC, COCA, COHA, and EHCB), we analyze the distribution and development of semantic categories for various words, including but not limited to "black" (with categories such as BE(COME)_BLACK, MAKE_BLACK, and APPLY_BLACKING). Our study currently evaluates the performance of GPT-4o-mini in semantic categorization tasks, achieving an overall accuracy of 85.7%. The research reveals significant patterns in semantic variation, with modern corpora showing higher accuracy rates (86.2% for BNC) compared to historical corpora (80.1% for EHCB). We identify key factors influencing semantic categorization, including contextual complexity, historical distance, and regional variation. The study contributes to both theoretical linguistics and computational methods by providing insights into semantic change, model performance, and annotation protocols. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of computational approaches in semantic analysis while highlighting the challenges of historical and regional variation. The research also proposes methodological improvements for semantic annotation and evaluation, offering practical applications for natural language processing and historical linguistics. The project is designed to be extensible, with a framework that allows for the addition of more words, semantic categories, and language models (both open and paid) in future research. This research is fully reproducible, with all code, data, and documentation publicly available. The framework is planned to be continuously improved with enhanced annotation protocols, more sophisticated evaluation metrics, and expanded model support in future iterations.
