# Annotation Process Documentation

## Overview
The annotation process in this project is designed to systematically analyze and categorize semantic variations of words across different corpora. This document outlines the methodology, guidelines, and quality control measures implemented in the annotation process.

## Data Collection

### Corpus Selection
The project utilizes multiple corpora for comprehensive semantic analysis:
- BNC (British National Corpus)
- COCA (Corpus of Contemporary American English)
- COHA (Corpus of Historical American English)
- EHCB (Early Historical Corpus of British English)


## Quality Assurance

### Inter-annotator Agreement
- Cohen's Kappa coefficient calculation
- Regular agreement checks
- Resolution of disagreements through discussion
- Documentation of consensus decisions

### Validation Process
1. **Initial Review**
   - Automated consistency checks
   - Pattern recognition
   - Error detection

2. **Expert Review**
   - Linguistic expert validation
   - Cross-corpus consistency
   - Historical accuracy verification

3. **Final Verification**
   - Random sampling
   - Cross-validation
   - Documentation of exceptions

## Corpus-Specific Considerations

### BNC Corpus
- Focus on contemporary British English
- Special attention to regional variations
- Consideration of register differences

### COCA Corpus
- Emphasis on American English usage
- Temporal distribution analysis
- Genre-specific patterns

### COHA Corpus
- Historical development tracking
- Diachronic changes
- Archaic usage patterns

### EHCB Corpus
- Early Modern English features
- Historical context importance
- Orthographic variations

## Annotation Tools and Infrastructure
